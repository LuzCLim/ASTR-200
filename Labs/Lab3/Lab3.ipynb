So small in fact that when you overplot error bars on the data points you can't even see them (you can do this to verify). So to demonstrate differences between weighted and unweighted fits here, let's inflate them by a factor of 50. Overplot both the unweighted and weighted lines together with the modern data (with y error bars) and an appropriate legend. \n",
