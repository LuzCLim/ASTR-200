Copy it to a new cell so that you preserve the original for reference. Then, play with it (change numbers, comment things out, etc.) until you can answer the following questions, which you should do here at the top of the notebook.\n",

Describe how you arrived at this question. You may need to play with the exoplanet database some in order to generate ideas, but your most recent labs and prelabs should help provide some ideas for how to effectively explore the dataset. List any questions or concerns that you have and outline some of the information gathering/exploratory analyses you will need to do to inform that question and complete the project. "
